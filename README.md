# Mapemo

An e-commerce mobile app that uses machine learning to predict the category of a product image.


When a user uploads the product image and chooses their location, a request will be sent to Flask as a backend to run the model created with tensorflow and gets the category of the product.

An emoji representing the product image will be choosen from the emojiCut folder and sent together with the category to the user.
